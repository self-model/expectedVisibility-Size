Optimization terminated: change in best function value less than options.FunctionTolerance.
FMINCON: 
Local minimum possible. Constraints satisfied.

fmincon stopped because the predicted change in the objective function
is less than the value of the function tolerance and constraints 
are satisfied to within the value of the constraint tolerance.

<stopping criteria details>

Optimization stopped because the predicted change in the objective function,
6.783015e-07, is less than options.FunctionTolerance = 1.000000e-06, and the maximum constraint
violation, 0.000000e+00, is less than options.ConstraintTolerance = 1.000000e-06.
